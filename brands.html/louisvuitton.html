        <span id="spanlouis">!Louis Vuitton Malletier, commonly known as Louis Vuitton (/luːˈiː vɪˈtɒn/ ⓘ, French: [lwi vɥitɔ̃] ⓘ), is a French luxury fashion house and company founded in 1854 by Louis Vuitton.[1] The label's LV monogram appears on most of its products, ranging from luxury bags and leather goods to ready-to-wear, shoes,[4] perfumes, watches, jewellery, accessories, sunglasses and books. Louis Vuitton is one of the world's leading international fashion houses. It sells its products through standalone boutiques, lease departments in high-end departmental stores, and through the e-commerce section of its website.[5][6]

            For six consecutive years (2006–2012), Louis Vuitton was named the world's most valuable luxury brand. Its 2012 valuation was US$25.9 billion.[7] In 2013, the valuation of the brand was US$28.4 billion with revenue of US$9.4 billion.[8] The company operates in 50 countries with more than 460 stores worldwide.[9]
            
            Louis Vuitton is a subsidiary of LVMH and has faced some episodes of criticism: continuous targeting due to its failures in ceasing forced labour,[10][11][12] alleged mistreatment of its models in 2017,[13] and a series of strong polemics in Barcelona, Catalonia (due to sponsoring the 2024 America's Cup) that involved an administratively opaque fashion show,[14][15][16] significant damages in the Park Güell's UNESCO World Heritage Site,[17] and multiple citizen protests against the company.[18][19][20]
            
            History
            Founding to World War II
            See also: Louis Vuitton (designer)
            The Louis Vuitton label was founded by Vuitton in 1854 on Rue Neuve des Capucines in Paris.[21] Louis Vuitton had observed that the HJ Cave Osilite[22] trunk could be easily stacked. In 1858, Vuitton introduced his flat-topped trunks with Trianon canvas, making them lightweight and airtight.[21] Before the introduction of Vuitton's trunks, rounded-top trunks were used, generally to promote water runoff, and thus could not be stacked. It was Vuitton's gray Trianon canvas flat trunk that allowed the ability to stack them on top of another with ease for voyages. Many other luggage makers later imitated Vuitton's style and design.[6]
            
            The company participated in the 1867 Universal Exhibition in Paris.[21] In 1871, Ōyama Iwao became the first recorded Japanese customer, ordering a set of luggage while in Paris as a military observer during the Franco-Prussian War.[23] To protect against the duplication of his look, Vuitton changed the Trianon design to a beige-and-brown stripes design in 1876.[6] By 1885, the company opened its first store in London on Oxford Street.[21] Soon thereafter, due to the continuing imitation of his look, in 1888, Vuitton created the Damier Canvas pattern, which bore a logo that reads "marque L. Vuitton déposée", which translates into "L. Vuitton registered trademark". In 1892, Louis Vuitton died, and the company's management passed to his son.</span>
